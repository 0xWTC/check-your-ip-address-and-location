# Check your IP address and location

A little app to check your IP address using https://wtfismyip.com/ that showcases how to do several useful things in Python:
* how classes work
* logging info and debug into a file
* handling exceptions and errors
* timing a process
* the mystical if __name__ == "__main__"
* getting stuff from the Internet using requests
* parsing json
* multithreading (yes, I know, it doesn't make any sense for this script, DO NOT HAMMER THEIR SERVER FFS)

Requirements:
* I'm using Python 3.9.6, but should work in any Python 3.6+
* No additional libraries
